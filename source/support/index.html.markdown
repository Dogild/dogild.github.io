### Mailing List

Cappuccino and Objective-J share Google Group mailing lists. There are
two main lists:

#### objectivej (General)

This list is for general discussion, questions, community
announcements (your new project, for example), etc. Anyone can join,
members can post, and it is unmoderated except for first time
posters (to prevent spam).

[Visit this group](http://groups.google.com/group/objectivej)

#### objectivej-dev

This list is for discussion of development of Cappucciono. Commit
messages are sent to this address. Code reviews on all commits are
welcome and encouraged. Architectural questions, ideas, etc. also
welcome. If you want to work on Cappuccino itself, this is the right
place to look.
